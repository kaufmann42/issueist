# Contribution Guide

Before contributing, please skim over the *most recent* version of this file. As devops improves/changes this file will be updated.


## Getting Started

This applicattion is a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that was packaged into a chrome extension for end users. For documentation we have taken advantage of the open source package [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

### Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/kaufmann42/issueist.git && cd issueist`
2. `npm install`

### Running the application

1. `npm run start`

### Running the docs

1. `npm run docs`

### Testing

1. `npm run test`


### Building for production

1. `npm run build`

## Testing

This codebase has the intention of keeping components presentational, meaning that they are really only responsible for presenting something to the DOM with minimal logic inside them. Instead we utilize services (in the `./src` dir) to handle complex logic. For each added service, unit tests as well as documentation should be standard. With that said, this is an open source project worked on using volunteer hours, so there's no need to go crazy.
