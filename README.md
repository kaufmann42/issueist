## Background

Browsing the web I frequently see material that is relevant to projects I host here on Github. More times than not, I keep this page open, open up a new tab, browse to Github.com, find the relevant repository and create a new issue by switching back and forth from my tabs.

I knew it could be better. So I looked online for a solution, when I could not find one (*I was shocked as well*), I took matters into my own hands and created issueist: A way to create issues, anywhere. I've open sourced this project, and plan to add features/maintain it in my free time (this means every few nights at 2 A.M.).

I use Github to store a lot of my ideas, projects (software & other), and everything else. It's really become a hub for everything in my life, and the issue ecosystem has become a northstar.

## Install

This application is hosted on the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/issueist/eiekclnnglajcfmddidpcipngednfena). It can be installed with just a few clicks using [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/issueist/eiekclnnglajcfmddidpcipngednfena).

## Usage

Issueist is created to be simple by design. Any features are add-on and unnecessary to capture the main value.

To Use:
1. Click the Issueist extension icon (top right of your browser).
2. Select the repo you want to post the issue to.
3. Give your issue a title and a body (accepts Github flavored Markdown syntax).

and that's it! The GIF below shows an example of this process.
